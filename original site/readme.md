This is my first full project after working through some Treehouse courses, and beginning the Code Louisville program. 

Goal: Plan, design, build, and implement a new, responsive website for a dental office. It will provide basic information about the practice to both current and new patients. This info will include the philosophy behind the dental practice, office hours, contact info, directions, provided services, and patient forms.
